Greetings! Finally, an individual opened this file, or maybe you were just looking for the
game launcher and misclicked this. Oh well, hope someone finds this interesting--it just helps
me keep track of what I've done.

 the shank).

v0.23
----------------------------
-Added Weapon Grenade
-Added Weapon Black Hole
-Grenade: explodes after 85 ms, deals damage based on how close anyone is, only affects those
 400 units within the grenade at explosion, pushes players
-Black Hole: Shoots a Orb that decays speed over 200 ms, after it beings its active phase, active
 phase attracts players and all bullets for every weapon, deals damage to anyone in contact with 
 center of the black hole

-Now in Beta!
-Lowered Damage on Black Hole's center, Black Holes now spawn tiny particles in a range dealing 1 damage
 each to anyone who comes in contact
-Added keys.dat and resolution.dat files allowing users to change the keybinds and resolution
 
v0.25 Beta
----------------------------
-Fixed Jumping to be more responsive
-Changed Pea Shooter so it does not take on the velocity of the player
-Added Water Bending--Replaces Pea Shooter currently (Pea Shooter still has a placeholder keybind)
-Water Bending: hold down hotkey to spawn water particles which flow around the user, release to shoot
 water that correspond to the angle of the crosshair (behind user as well), can hold up to 300 water
 drops maximum, if water bending is charged up to the maximum amount of water drops, they shoot
 all at once

v0.26 Beta
----------------------------
-Added Weapon Shackle Shot
-Shackle Shot: shoots out three shackles with two hooks for each. Ignores platforms initially--seeks
 enemy collision then platform collision and roots them once each are hooked. Hook duration depends on
 distance the shackle traveled (about 75ms-400ms duration). Can be multiple shackles on one target. Enemies'
 grappling hooks have no effect while rooted.
-Fixed a bug where jumping allowed characters to move through downward accelerating platforms.
-Changed jump so that it sets players to a certain speed instead of additive speed. Overall jumping is 
 more consistent.
-Fixed a bug with grappling hook shooting
